Torpedo is a test suite to qualify storage providers for stateful containers running in a distributed environment.  It tests various scenarios that applications encounter when running in Linux containers and deployed via schedulers such as Kubernetes, Marathon or Swarm.

## CSI
CSI is a specification for Linux Container Storage Interfaces.  It defines the control plane interaction between a cloud native scheduler such as Kubernetes, and a cloud native storage provider.  The specification is available [here](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md).

The Torpedo test suite natively supports the CSI specification for external volume support into Kubernetes and Mesosphere.  It operates as a CSI enabled orchestrator (scheduler) to communicate with external storage providers that support CSI.

Torpedo tests cover the various scheduler-storage integration points that are being addressed by the CSI specification (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JMNVNP-ZHz8cGlnqckOnpJmHF-DNY7IYP-Di7iuVhQI/edit#) and how external volume providers like Portworx are able to support production level operational scenarios when it comes to storage, server, software or network failures.

### Legacy support
Since CSI is currently still work in progress, most schedulers provide external volume support to Mesosphere or Kubernetes via DVDI or the Kubernetes native driver interface.

Docker volume driver interface (DVDI) provides the control path operations to create, mount, unmount and eventually delete an external volume and is documented [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_volume/).

In order to support legacy storage drivers, Torpedo can also work with schedulers that still use the Docker volume driver interface.

## Scenarios to Consider when Deploying Stateful Applications
Deploying ephemeral applications require less consideration when compared to stateful applications.  When running stateful applications in production, administrators should take into account various runtime scenarios that may occur and chose an external storage provider that is capable of dealing with these situations.  Examples of these scenarios are:

### Runtime software hangs and crashes
* Container runtime engine (or scheduler) software failure, hang or crash:  When a daemon, like Docker crashes, it can induce errors with an application's connectivity to the external storage.  This problem is compounded when the storage provider itself, runs as a container.  In general, you need to assume that user space code will either hang or crash, and the storage system needs to gracefully deal with this, without data loss, unavailability or corruption.
* External storage driver software failure, hang or crash:  When the storage software itself crashes, the overall solution needs to make sure that there are no lost IOs (data loss), unavailability or corruption.

### Network and host issues
* Network disconnect from the storage provider to the external environment:  If a node on which the storage volume driver is running were to become disconnected from the network, the overall solution needs to make sure that the volume can be used on another node, and that there is no data loss or corruption.
* A node running a stateful application becomes permanently (or for a prolonged period of time) unreachable:  In many cases, a node can become permanently unusable.  In cases, such as AWS, when an EBS volume is attached to such a node, the overall solution needs to make sure that the volume or the data can somehow still be used on some other node in the cluster.
* A network partition in the cluster:  When the scheduler cluster or the storage cluster gets partitioned in such a way that quorum is lost, the nodes that are still part of the quorum need to be able to use all of the data that was in the original cluster.  Otherwise, this would lead to data unavailability.

### Scheduler software issues
* Scheduler software attempts to deploy a stateful container on a node that is not part of the storage cluster:  It is possible that the storage cluster and the scheduler cluster do not comprise of the same machines.  The overall solution must prevent, or somehow make sure that when a stateful application is deployed on a non-storage node, that the application's storage requirements are fulfilled.  Some approaches to handle this include the use of scheduler constraints and labels.
* Scheduler software attempts to bring up a new container/pod/task to use a storage volume prior to properly terminating the previous container/pod/task on a different host:  Scheduler software, perhaps due to bugs or timing issues, may launch a new application stack on a new set of nodes that refer to a volume currently in use by an application stack being torn down.  The overall solution must be capable of dealing with these transition scenarios, without application data loss or corruption.
